    Dear Mr/Mrs (name of recipient),

I am writing this application to inform that I am taking my leave for a long period. Since my yearly allowance is left, hence I would like to avail of all my leaves.

I request you to kindly approve my leave for 20 days, as I will be going for a long vacation with my family and will stay out of the station these days. Therefore, I would like to take leave from (start date) till (end-date).

I have assigned my work to (name of the person) for the time period when I would not be available. Since we are working on the same team, so he/she knows the work very well. Most of the tasks I have already finished, only a little part is left to be carried out by him/her.

I am always available on my phone or emails if anything required.

I will be resuming my work since (date) and take care of the rest of the work.

Thanks for the consideration.

Yours Sincerely,
(Name).
